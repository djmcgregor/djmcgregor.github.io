My research focuses on
{: style="font-size: 1em;"}

* Assessing and predicting the quality of additively manufactured (AM) parts using machine vision, machine learning, and various statistical techniques.  
*	Developing an analysis framework for analyzing complex, 3D parts, especially those with internal features that are not measurable using traditional techniques.  
*	Investigated the mechanical properties of AM lattice structures.  
*	Simulated various loading conditions in ABAQUS to validate theoretical models and experimental results.
