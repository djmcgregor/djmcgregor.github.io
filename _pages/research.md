{% include feature_row id="king_research"%}

Additive Manufacturing Quality - [King](https://kinglab.mechse.illinois.edu/) and [Tawfick](https://tawfick.mechse.illinois.edu/) Labs
{: style="font-size: 1em;"}
* Evaluate and predict quality of AM parts using computer vision, machine learning, and statistics
* Developing an automated analysis framework for inspecting complex, 3D parts, especially those with internal features
* Devise novel, optical metrology systems for extracting 1000+ geometric dimensions from complex, lattice parts
* Analyze computed tomography (CT) and variable focus microscopy (VFM) datasets using Python
* Investigate mechanical properties of materials and lattice parts produced through production grade AM
* Simulate various loading conditions in ABAQUS to validate lattice material models and experimental results
