Additive Manufacturing Quality - [King](https://kinglab.mechse.illinois.edu/) and [Tawfick](https://tawfick.mechse.illinois.edu/) Labs
{: style="font-size: 1em;"}
* Developed methods for scalable dimensional measurements and quality assessment of additively manufactured parts using computer vision, machine learning, and statistics
* Developed automated analysis frameworks for inspecting complex, 3D parts, especially those with internal features that are not measurable using traditional techniques
* Investigated additive manufacturing processes and materials using X-ray computed tomography (CT), variable focus microscopy (VFM), and optical images
* Investigated mechanical properties and manufacturability of additively manufactured lattices
* Developed a Python package for computer vision metrology in manufacturing (open-source pip install release coming soon)
* Simulated lattice compression testing in ABAQUS to validate lattice material models and experimental results
