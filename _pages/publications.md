  title: 10. Using machine learning to predict dimensions and qualify diverse part designs across multiple additive machines and materials
  journal: Additive Manufacturing
  date: July 2022
  abstract: We developed a data model that describes additive part design information and manufacturing process information using both continuous and categorical variables. A support vector regression (SVR) machine learning model is trained using this data to predict part geometry to within 53 microns. The model is extended to classify the parts as either acceptable or unacceptable with 81% accuracy.

  title: 9. Large batch metrology on internal features of additively manufactured parts using X-ray computed tomography
  journal: Journal of Materials Processing Technology
  date: April 2022
  abstract: This study presents an automated method for batch X-ray computed tomography (CT) metrology using open-source software, and investigates 48 nozzle parts made using various additive manufacturing materials and processes. We find that external feature accuracy is not highly correlated with internal feature accuracy. Additionally, part-to-part repeatability for a given material and process is very good.

  title: 8. Hierarchical data models improve the accuracy of feature level predictions for additively manufactured parts
  journal: Additive Manufacturing
  date: January 2022
  abstract: A Hierarchical Bayesian Linear Model (HBLM) models the effects of multiple additive manufacturing production factors on part geometry. Gaussian process (GP) captures the feature-level spatial variation that can be unique to each part. Together, these models predict part geometry to within 10 microns.

  title: 7. Ultra-power-dense heat exchanger development through genetic algorithm design and additive manufacturing
  journal: Joule
  date: September 2021
  abstract: We show design automation and additive manufacturing that can achieve high heat transfer with complex 3D structures internal to the heat exchanger that cannot be made with conventional methods. The resulting device achieves a power density and specific power significantly higher than that of most conventional heat exchangers.

  title: 6. Effect of an added mass on the vibration characteristics for raster scanning of a cantilevered optical fiber
  journal: ASME J. of Medical Diagnostics
  date: May 2021
  abstract: Piezoelectric tube actuators with cantilevered optical fibers enable the miniaturization of scanning image acquisition techniques for endoscopic implementation. We explore adding a mass at an intermediate location along the length of the fiber to alter the resonant frequencies of the system and enable raster scanning. We provide a mathematical model to predict resonant frequencies for a cantilevered beam with an intermediate mass.

  title: 4. Emergency ventilator for COVID-19
  journal: PLOS ONE
  date: December 2020
  abstract: In response to the need for mechanical ventilators, we designed and tested an emergency ventilator (EV) that can control a patientâ€™s peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and breathing rate, while keeping a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). This article describes the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of the EV. The development process was enabled by rapid design iterations using additive manufacturing (AM). In the initial design phase, iterations between design, AM, and testing enabled a working prototype within one week.

  title: 3. Automated metrology and geometric analysis of additively manufactured lattice structures
  journal: Additive Manufacturing
  date: August 2019
  abstract: Conventional methods for measuring part geometry and performing quality control, which typically use a small number of low-dimensional measurements, are not well suited for the complex structures enabled by additive manufacturing (AM), such as lattice structures. This paper describes a method for scanning and automatically extracting hundreds of individual features and applies this method to characterize AM lattice structures in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices.

  title: 2. Mechanical properties of hexagonal lattice structures fabricated using continuous liquid interface production additive manufacturing
  journal: Additive Manufacturing
  date: January 2019
  abstract: Recent advancements in AM have enabled rapid production speeds, high spatial resolution, and a variety of engineering polymers. An open question remains whether production grade additive manufacturing (AM) can accurately and repeatably produce lattice parts. This study presents design, production, and mechanical property testing of hexagonal lattice parts manufactured using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) based AM.

  title: 1. Single lens system for forward-viewing navigation and scanning side-viewing optical coherence tomography
  journal: Proc. SPIE 10040, Endoscopic Microscopy XII
  date: February 2017
  abstract: The optical design for a dual modality endoscope based on piezo scanning fiber technology is presented including a novel technique to combine forward-viewing navigation and side viewing OCT. Potential applications include navigating body lumens such as the fallopian tube, biliary ducts and cardiovascular system. A custom cover plate provides a rotationally symmetric double reflection of the OCT beam to deviate and focus the OCT beam out the side of the endoscope for cross-sectional imaging of the tubal lumen.
