Research keeps me pretty busy, but I also enjoy
{: style="font-size: 1em;"}

* Working out -- especially triathlon (swim, bike, run)
* Learning new programming skills / languages
* Cooking and baking -- the experimental method yields excellent sourdough
* Photography -- mostly long exposure, landscape, and action
* Outreach to younger students interested in STEM
