## Distributional Deep Q-learning
* Implemented Google’s C51 algorithm in PyTorch, and trained it on various Atari games such as Pong and Breakout
* Exploited high performance GPU computing to run highly parallelized, batch jobs on the Blue Waters supercomputer
* Programmed single-layer networks from scratch and tuned hyperparameters for CNN, RL, and NLP deep neural networks

## Modeling and Evolutionary Optimization
* Simulated slithering snake and elastocapillary fins using 1D Cosserat rods and position-Verlet time integration in Python
* Modeled muscular activations, elastocapillary forces, friction and self-contact boundary conditions
* Implemented covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) in Python to minimize generic loss functions
* Employed CMA-ES for 40 generations to maximize the snake’s forward velocity and achieve desired fin mechanics

## Turbulence Compensation Table - University of Arizona Senior Design
* Devised a two axis, active suspension table system for use in a super first-class airplane suite with five colleagues from various engineering disciplines. Awarded the Excellence in Aerospace Electronic System Design prize
* Utilized GD&T and manually machined over twenty moving parts for final table assembly
* Conducted rigorous trade studies and communicated limitations with sponsor to adjust design requirements
