  - excerpt: ' My current research aims to answer whether production grade additive manufacturing (AM) can accurately and repeatedly produce lattice parts.
  These lattice parts comprise hundreds of slender members, each of which can significantly impact the overall lattice performance. I have developed an
  optically based, measurement protocol to quantify lattice part quality and compare predicted part performance to the designed performance. I currently 
  employ this metrology to analyze large batches of AM parts, and explore the possibility of predicting AM part flaws using machine learning and statistics.'
