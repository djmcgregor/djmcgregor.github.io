I've watched Mehmet work tirelessly on developing microfluidic mixing devices over the past year or so. I feel honored to work
among such innovative colleagues and bounce ideas off each other. COVID testing is just one of many scenarios where rapid,
point-of-care testing is essential to the health of a community. The linked UIUC press release and PNAS journal publication are 
definitely worth a read.
