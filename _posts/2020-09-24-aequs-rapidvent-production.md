Aequs, one of India’s lead manufacturing companies, has announced that they will be producing a variant of the UIUC RapidVent in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The ventilator, which operates on pressurized oxygen, is ideal for deployment in “non-electrified locations and in situations with limited medical facilities.” Aequs has committed to deliver 2,000 units per month and intends to scale production to 10,000 per month. The devices are locally manufactured in Belagavi under the name AQovent.
