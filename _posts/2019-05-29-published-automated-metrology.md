### Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of complex lattice structures, for which a single part may
have hundreds or thousands of individual geometric features. Conventional methods for measuring part geometry
and performing quality control, which typically use a small number of low-dimensional measurements,
are not well suited for lattice structures. This paper describes a method for scanning and automatically extracting
individual features of the lattice and applies this method to characterize AM lattice structures in both twodimensional
and three-dimensional lattices. The research measured 94 lattice parts fabricated from 3 materials
in 9 different designs using either a high-resolution document scanner or X-ray computed tomography (CT). A
statistical analysis considered manufacturing variances as a function of material type and part design on a subset
of the data, comprising the size and location of over 15,000 individual features. We studied the geometric
variations of these struts in uniform, hierarchical and gradated parts. For a single design and material, the
standard deviation of lattice feature size is quite small. For example, a lattice strut with thickness 0.5mm has a
standard deviation of 30 Î¼m. However, when the same process is used to manufacture multiple parts having
different designs and from different materials, the standard deviation of feature size can be larger by 2X or more.
This type of automated measurement and analysis may allow for rigorous monitoring, qualification and control
of AM lattice parts in production.
