excerpt: First mechanical tests of CLIP lattice parts.

I recently attended the [International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium on Architectured Material Mechanics](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IUTAM2018AMS/)
in Chicago, IL. In addition to networking with some of the leading experts in the field, I presented some preliminary research
at a poster session. My work has been featured in several additive manufacturing magazines and downloaded over 400 times.
